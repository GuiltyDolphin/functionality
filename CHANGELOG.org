- =Unwrap= interface for values that can be unwrapped

** Changed

- =Bind= interface replaced with =Monad=
  - now required to provide a definition of =pure=
- =join= is no longer exported as a top-level function from
  =src/maybe.ts= and =src/monad.ts=, but is now a class method
  of =AMonad= from =src/monad.ts=
- =joinLeft= is no longer top-level in =src/either.ts=, but is
  in =EitherComponent=
- =mod.ts= and =src/functional.ts= now export =Either= and
  =Maybe= only as types, use =either= and =maybe= for the
  respective namespaces
- monads may now specify =bind= or =join= (the definition of
  the other will be inferred automatically)
- non-empty array types now support (optionally) specifying
  the type of the first element
- =unEither= is no longer top-level in =src/either.ts=, but is
  in =EitherComponent=
- unwrapping is now more type safe (e.g., you can only
  left-unwrap an =Either<L, R>= if you have established that
  it is actually a left value)
