- =Unwrap= interface for values that can be unwrapped

** Changed

- =Bind= interface replaced with =Monad=
  - now required to provide a definition of =pure=
- =mod.ts= and =src/functional.ts= now export =Either= and
  =Maybe= only as types, use =either= and =maybe= for the
  respective namespaces
- unwrapping is now more type safe (e.g., you can only
  left-unwrap an =Either<L, R>= if you have established that
  it is actually a left value)

** Added
