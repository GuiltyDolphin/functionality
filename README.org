* Development

** Coverage

To generate code test coverage, make sure you have access to
the =genhtml= tool (e.g., via the [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lcov/][lcov package on AUR]]), then
run =make coverage= in the top-level of the project.

** Testing

Run =make test= in the top-level of the project to run the
tests. If you need to see results for tests that passed, run
=make test_verbose= or =deno test= instead.
